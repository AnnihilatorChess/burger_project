# burger_project<br>
 **Motivation**<br>
This is a for fun project, where i analyzed my burger consumption at Burgerista. JKU-students got a special 1+1 deal, which is the reason I visited so often. When i was there i almost always paid by card. This enabled me to export my debit transaction data and analyze it, which is what this project is about. <br>
**Method** <br>
First of all I needed to clean and structure the transaction data, which I did in clean_data.py using pandas. In data_exploration.ipynb I created a couple of plots, which I used to analyze the trend, frequency, timing and diet impact of my Burgerista visits. I then put these graphs with some summary statistics into Burger Report.pdf where I wrote a short introduction and presented my findings in German.
