# Burger Project  

### **Motivation**  
This is a fun little project where I analyzed my burger consumption at *Burgerista*. As a JKU student, I took full advantage of their 1+1 deal, which explains why I visited so often. Since I almost always paid by card, I was able to export my debit transaction history and dig into the data. Thatâ€™s what this project is all about.  

### **Method**  
1. **Data Cleaning**: Structured raw transaction data using pandas in [`clean_data.py`](clean_data.py).  
2. **Exploration**: Created visualizations in [`data_exploration.ipynb`](data_exploration.ipynb) to analyze trends, frequency, timing, and dietary impact.  
3. **Reporting**: Compiled graphs and summary stats into ["Burger Report.pdf"](Burger%20Report.pdf), with a short intro (in German).
